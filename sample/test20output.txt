For test20.txt:
We are testing that a transaction can later write to a variable that is read-locked by itself.
And after that write operation, the variable becomes write-locked and later operations on the same
variable are all write-locked by the write operation.

operation, the variable is still write-locked. Thus, when there comes read or write operation later,
they are put into wait list. In this case, R(T2, x1) operation must wait until T1 commit or abort.
