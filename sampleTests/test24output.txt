test24.txt:
The read-only transaction T1 is executed when it begins, which is beginRO(T1). Thus, the failure of
site 4 does not affect T1.

test24a.txt:
Read-only transaction T1 tries to read variable x3 from site 4. However, site 4 fails before the
begin of T1. In this case, the read instruction R(T1, x3) is recorded in wait list and it is
waiting for the site 4 to recover.

test24b.txt:
This test shows that only committed values before read-only transaction can affect RO transactions'
read. The read instruction of RO transaction T1 still gets the previous value 30 of variable x3.
Afterwards, when T2 commits, x3's value is changed to 1.
