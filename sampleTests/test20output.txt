For test20.txt:
We are testing that a transaction can later write to a variable that is read-locked by itself.
And after that write operation, the variable becomes write-locked and later operations on the same
variable are all write-locked by the write operation.

For test20a.txt:
A transaction can read a variable that is write-locked by itself. However, even with this read
operation, the variable is still write-locked. Thus, when there comes read or write operation later,
they are put into wait list. In this case, R(T2, x1) operation must wait until T1 commit or abort.

For test20b.txt:
There is a shared read lock on variable x2. Thus, the instruction W(T1,x2,1) is put into wait list.
Thus, when process end(T1), T1 still has instruction in the wait list and thus, is aborted.
